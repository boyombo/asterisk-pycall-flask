# asterisk-pycall-flask
A demo application for using pycall to place calls between 2 subscribers using the hotvoip sip provider.
Note that you should have a hotvoip account and you should have configured asterisk with the spool directory in /var/spool/asterisk/

The conf/sip.conf and conf/extensions.conf files contain basic asterisk configurations and should be put in the asterisk configurations directory. Usually */etc/asterisk/sip.conf*  and  */etc/asterisk/extensions.conf*
